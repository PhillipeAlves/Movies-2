## The Project

This project is a second version of the [movies](https://github.com/PhillipeAlves/Movies-1 "Movies 1") app OMDb Api. The concept is pretty simple. The app allows the user the search for a movie by its title and by the search input the user can visualize the main information about the movie, like actors, directors, plot, year of production and ratings. The difference in this one is that the search is broad and it finds multiple titles that have a similar name.
